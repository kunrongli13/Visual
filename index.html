                <p>The theme of the images I have created is Me and the City, this is a set of collage images in that consists of six images, each two images will form a sub-theme. The three themes will show three different scales from largest to smallest, they are City, Architecture, and Windows and Doors. I mainly wanted to use these images to explore my memories with both eastern and western cultures. The first set of collage was inspired by myself, as a newcomer to London, I am always new to things around me and want to document them. So in these images, I collaged the cityscape with the people observing or taking pictures. I used the lasso tool in photoshop to crop the people and adjust the size of them to give an exaggerated scale to express the view of London tourists observing the city. In addition to adjusting the proportions of the figures, to make the images more harmonious, I used the filters of brightness and hue to adjust the overall saturation and tone of the city as well as the figures. The second set of images is an attempt to blend the traditional Chinese architecture with the modern architecture of the West in a collage. The inspiration for this set of images came from my memories of my hometowns ancient properties, which is the traditional architecture of China. Chinese traditional architecture has a long history, while the West is also the birthplace of modern architecture, I try to use collage form to make these two cultures to merge and collide, such as Chinese ancient roofs and Western modern architecture structure collocation and so on. As with the last set of images, I used the lasso tool and ctrl T a lot, adjust at the proportions, the structure of the image and the relationship between the lines to create a new spatial form out of a completely different material. The last set of images zooms into the scale of urban thresholds. The elements of windows and doors are of various sizes, materials and uses. Using collage, I rearranged these windows and doors to form a new threshold. The focus of this set of images is studying of straight and curved lines in the image, and by adjusting the cut-out material, the different lines are smoothly connected.</p>

                Pablo Picasso is the artist who most influenced me the most in this assignment. A a pioneer of collage and abstraction art, Picasso fragmented completed images in life, reorganized and combined them and finally presented his paintings in a fragmented form. In addition to the use of distorted and irregular shapes, and create new geometries in his paintings, Picasso also studied and experimented how to fuse different media together, such as newspapers and oil painting canvases, and the vellum.

                Another interesting idea that I would like to apply to my collages is the reflective design. This concept is Proposed by Don Norman. He describes this type of design as the highest level of emotional design, it involves rationalizing and intelligence of products. Reflective design also helps to rationalize environmental information, which in turn influences the level of behavior (Komninos, 2021). In general, I wanted to make it possible for people to reflect on their connection to their city and home through the creation of my collage.
